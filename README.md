   print("Hello, World!")
Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements
print Function:

print is a built-in Python function used to output text to the console.
Functions in Python are called using their name followed by parentheses ().
Parentheses ():

Parentheses are used to pass arguments to functions. Here, "Hello, World!" is passed as an argument to the print function.
String "Hello, World!":

"Hello, World!" is a string literal in Python, enclosed in double quotes.
Strings can also be enclosed in single quotes 'Hello, World!'.

Save the code in a file with a .py extension, for example, hello_world.py.
Run the Program:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the program by typing python hello_world.py (or python3 hello_world.py on some systems) and pressing Enter.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.


Basic Data Types in Python
Integer (int):

Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
Example: 42, -3

Float (float):

Numbers, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
Example: 3.14, -0.001

String (str):

Sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.
Example: "Hello", 'World', """Python"""

Boolean (bool):

Represents one of two values: True or False.
Example: True, False

List (list):

Ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types.
Example: [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

Tuple (tuple):

Ordered, immutable collection of items.
Example: (1, 2, 3), ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

Dictionary (dict):

Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Example: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
Set (set):

Unordered collection of unique items.
Example: {1, 2, 3}, {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

# Integer
age = 30
print("Age:", age)  # Output: Age: 30

# Float
pi = 3.14159
print("Pi:", pi)  # Output: Pi: 3.14159

# String
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name)  # Output: Name: Alice

# Boolean
is_student = True
print("Is student:", is_student)  # Output: Is student: True

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("Fruits:", fruits)  # Output: Fruits: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)  # Output: Coordinates: (10.0, 20.0)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print("Person:", person)  # Output: Person: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print("Unique numbers:", unique_numbers)  # Output: Unique numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

   Control Structures in Python
Control structures allow you to manage the flow of your program. The two primary types are conditional statements and loops.

Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

if-else Statement
The if-else statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

Syntax:

python
Copy code
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
else:
    # code to execute if condition is false
Example:

python
Copy code
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.You can posssess a driving license")
else:
    print("You are a minor.You cannot possess a driving license")
Explanation:

If age is greater than or equal to 18, the program prints "You are an adult.You can posssess a driving license"
If age is less than 18, the program prints "You are a minor.You cannot possess a driving license"
Loops
Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.

for Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).

Syntax:

python
Copy code
for item in sequence:
//code to execute for each item
Example:

python
Copy code
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
   #print(fruit)
Explanation:

The for loop iterates over each item in the fruits list.
During each iteration, the current item (fruit) is printed.
Complete Examples
if-else Statement Example
python
Copy code
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day.")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a nice day.")
else:
    print("It's a cold day.")
Explanation:

If temperature is greater than 30, it prints "It's a hot day."
If temperature is greater than 20 (and not greater than 30), it prints "It's a nice day."
If temperature is 20 or less, it prints "It's a cold day."
for Loop Example
python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)
Explanation:

The for loop iterates over each item in the numbers list.
During each iteration, the current item (number) is printed.





6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to organize your code, make it more readable, and reduce redundancy. Functions are useful because they help to modularize your code, making it easier to test, maintain, and understand.

Defining a Function
A function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses () which may include parameters.

Syntax:

python
Copy code
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return value
Example: Function to Sum Two Numbers
Here’s a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

python
Copy code
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two arguments a and b,
    and returns their sum.
    """
    return a + b
Calling the Function
You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses, passing the required arguments inside the parentheses.

Example:

python
Copy code
# Call the function and store the result in a variable
result = add_numbers(5, 3)

# Print the result
print("The sum is:", result)
Complete Example with Explanation
python
Copy code
# Define the function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two arguments a and b,
    and returns their sum.
    """
    return a + b

# Call the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)

# Print the result
print("The sum is:", result)
Explanation:

Function Definition:

def add_numbers(a, b): defines a function named add_numbers that takes two parameters a and b.
return a + b returns the sum of a and b.
Function Call:

result = add_numbers(5, 3) calls the add_numbers function with arguments 5 and 3, and stores the result in the variable result.
print("The sum is:", result) prints the result, which is 8.

   


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
Differences Between Lists and Dictionaries in Python
Feature	List	Dictionary
Definition	An ordered collection of items.	An unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Syntax	Defined using square brackets [].	Defined using curly braces {}.
Indexing	Accessed by index (0, 1, 2, ...).	Accessed by keys.
Order	Maintains the order of elements.	Does not maintain order (Python 3.7+ maintains insertion order).
Duplicates	Allows duplicate elements.	Keys must be unique; values can be duplicated.
Mutability	Mutable (can be changed).	Mutable (can be changed).
Example Script
Below is a Python script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with key-value pairs, demonstrating basic operations on both.

python
Copy code
# Creating a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Basic operations on the list
print("List of numbers:", numbers)

# Adding an element to the list
numbers.append(60)
print("After appending 60:", numbers)

# Removing an element from the list
numbers.remove(30)
print("After removing 30:", numbers)

# Accessing an element by index
first_number = numbers[0]
print("First number:", first_number)

# Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Basic operations on the dictionary
print("\nDictionary:", person)

# Adding a key-value pair
person["job"] = "Engineer"
print("After adding job:", person)

# Removing a key-value pair
del person["age"]
print("After removing age:", person)

# Accessing a value by key
name = person["name"]
print("Name:", name)
Explanation of the Script
List Operations:

Creating a List: numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] initializes a list of numbers.
Appending an Element: numbers.append(60) adds 60 to the end of the list.
Removing an Element: numbers.remove(30) removes 30 from the list.
Accessing an Element: first_number = numbers[0] retrieves the first element of the list.
Dictionary Operations:

Creating a Dictionary: person = { "name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York" } initializes a dictionary with key-value pairs.
Adding a Key-Value Pair: person["job"] = "Engineer" adds a new key job with the value Engineer.
Removing a Key-Value Pair: del person["age"] deletes the key age from the dictionary.
Accessing a Value: name = person["name"] retrieves the value associated with the key name.












8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to manage errors gracefully, preventing crashes and enabling you to respond to errors in a controlled way. It uses try, except, and finally blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

Key Components
try Block: Code that might raise an exception is placed inside the try block.
except Block: This block is executed if an exception occurs in the try block. You can specify the type of exception to catch or use a general except to catch any exception.
finally Block: This block is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not, often used for cleanup actions.
Example of Exception Handling
Here’s a simple example that demonstrates the use of try, except, and finally:

python
Copy code
def divide_numbers(num1, num2):
    try:
        # Attempt to divide two numbers
        result = num1 / num2
        print("Result:", result)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Handle division by zero exception
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
    except TypeError:
        # Handle type errors (e.g., non-numeric input)
        print("Error: Both inputs must be numbers.")
    finally:
        print("Execution completed.")

# Test the function
divide_numbers(10, 2)  # Valid division
divide_numbers(10, 0)  # Division by zero
divide_numbers(10, "a")  # Invalid input type
Explanation
try Block:

The code result = num1 / num2 attempts to divide num1 by num2.
If num2 is zero, a ZeroDivisionError will be raised.
except Block:

The first except block catches ZeroDivisionError and prints an error message when a division by zero occurs.
The second except block catches TypeError, which might occur if non-numeric values are provided.
finally Block:

The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception was raised or handled, allowing you to perform any necessary cleanup actions. Here, it prints "Execution completed."

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   Modules are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. They allow you to organize your code into manageable sections and promote code reuse. A module is simply a Python file with a .py extension.

Packages are collections of modules organized in a directory hierarchy. A package typically contains a special __init__.py file that indicates the directory should be treated as a package. Packages help in organizing related modules and facilitating namespace management.

Importing and Using a Module
To use a module in your script, you can import it using the import statement. You can import an entire module or specific functions/classes from it.

Example Using the math Module
The math module provides mathematical functions and constants.

Importing the Module:

python
Copy code
import math
Using Functions from the Module:

python
Copy code
# Calculate the square root of a number
square_root = math.sqrt(16)
print("Square root of 16:", square_root)

# Calculate the value of pi
pi_value = math.pi
print("Value of pi:", pi_value)

# Calculate the cosine of an angle in radians
cosine_value = math.cos(math.pi / 3)
print("Cosine of 60 degrees:", cosine_value)
Complete Example
python
Copy code
# Import the math module
import math

# Calculate the square root of 16
square_root = math.sqrt(16)
print("Square root of 16:", square_root)

# Calculate the value of pi
pi_value = math.pi
print("Value of pi:", pi_value)

# Calculate the cosine of 60 degrees
cosine_value = math.cos(math.pi / 3)
print("Cosine of 60 degrees:", cosine_value)
Output
yaml
Copy code
Square root of 16: 4.0
Value of pi: 3.141592653589793
Cosine of 60 degrees: 0.5000000000000001
Conclusion

10. File I/O:
